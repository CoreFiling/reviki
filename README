# Markdown support

Markdown is now supported as an alternative page format to WikiCreole.

This can be switched on a per-page basis in the UI, or the default can be set
across the wiki by adding:

* = reviki:syntax=markdown

to the bottom of the ConfigAutoProperties page. Note that this will change the
setting for all pages including editing existing ones written in creole.
