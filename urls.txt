Not sure about ConfigBasic, really it is more fundamental than
the $wikiName sections.

Perhaps keep /configuration but make it a map from $wikiName to
SVN URL.  Also need to come up for some kind of security for that
... but later.

Other parts now implemented but only with the 'pages' wiki.  The
FindPage doesn't work as a page though, only with '?query=...'.
We should add a build-in page that explains search.
