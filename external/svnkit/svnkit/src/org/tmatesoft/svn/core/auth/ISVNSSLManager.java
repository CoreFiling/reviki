/**
 * The <b>ISVNSSLManager</b> interface is intended for 
 * creating secure SSL contexts over sockets used for data i/o. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * When accessing a repository over http:// there's a risk that 
 * passwords (in the case of a BASIC authentication they are transmitted 
 * as a plain text) may be sniffed by a malefactor. SSL manager provides 
 * a secure connection encrypting all data i/o over a socket.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To get an SSL manager to access a particular repository use the 
 * {@link ISVNAuthenticationManager#getSSLManager(SVNURL) getSSLManager()} 
 * method of an authentication manager.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A default implementation of <b>ISVNSSLManager</b> (that comes along 
 * with a default implementation of <b>ISVNAuthenticationManager</b> - <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.internal.wc.DefaultSVNAuthenticationManager</b>) 
 * uses ssl options from the standard <i>servers</i> file (it can be found in the 
 * Subversion runtime configuration area - read more {@link org.tmatesoft.svn.core.wc.ISVNOptions here}).  
 * That is to accept a server certificate, it first looks for the "trusted" CA sertificate in the in-memory 
 * runtime auth storage (see {@link ISVNAuthenticationStorage}). If the one is not found, it then tries to 
 * find it in the disk auth storage in the runtime config area. Also if the 
 * <span class="javastring">"ssl-trust-default-ca"</span> is set to <span class="javastring">"yes"</span>, then 
 * SVNKit will trust those CAs found in the JDK "JKS" KeyStore. User certificates are also got from the 
 * options in the <i>servers</i> file.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An SSL manager is invoked when a user tries to access a repository via the https:// protocol.
