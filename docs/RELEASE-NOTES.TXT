First formal release.  Changes noted are since r1022.

  is still done on first access.

  names [dbug 5821].  To fully benefit from this improvement, search index
  folders should be deleted from the reviki-data directory.

* CSS changes to improve table formatting.  Note this requires custom ConfigCss
  pages to be deleted [dbug 5978].

  touched more than one file [dbug 6299].

* Ensure HTTP connections to the SVN server are closed after each request.

* Automatic inter-wiki links for other wikis on the same instance.
