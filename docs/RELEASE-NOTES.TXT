0.1.0 (2010-06-11)
------------------

First formal release.  Changes noted are since r1022.

* Now supported on Jetty.

* Cross-wiki search.  Note this requires all wikis to have been indexed, which
  is still done on first access.

* Keyboard shortcuts for edit, save and cancel, with prompt to confirm cancel.

* Fix for incoming/outgoing links calculation for pages with spaces in their
  names [dbug 5821].  To fully benefit from this improvement, search index
  folders should be deleted from the reviki-data directory.

* Fix compare feature to work across page renames [dbug 5813].

* CSS changes to improve table formatting.  Note this requires custom ConfigCss
  pages to be deleted [dbug 5978].

* Fix attachment pages that were showing irrelevant files for commits that
  touched more than one file [dbug 6299].

* Ensure HTTP connections to the SVN server are closed after each request.
