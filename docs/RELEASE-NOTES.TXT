Reviki

                              Version History

0.3.2 (2014-06-23)
------------------

* Fixed an issue introduced in 0.3.0 that causes excessive consumption of
  CPU and RAM on busy servers.
  [bug 44604]


0.3.1 (2014-06-05)
------------------

* Fixed an issue introduced in 0.3.0 that prevented the atom view of a page's
  history from working.
  [bug 44456]


0.3.0 (2014-05-09)
------------------

* The UI has been significantly updated.
  [bug 40263]

* Improvements to the page rename functionality.  Page renames now generate
  useful commit messages and visiting a renamed page now gives a link to the
  new location.
  [bug 5949, 42526]

* Page edits are now automatically saved to the browser's local storage
  and can be restored if the edit is accidentally cancelled.
  [bug 10370]

* Parsing of URLs inside explicit hyperlinks (the [[...]] syntax) is now
  less strict, for example unescaped spaces are now allowed.  This corrects
  a regression introduced in 0.2.0.
  [bug 13502]

* Clicking on search results from other wikis now behaves the same as
  clicking on results from the current wiki and takes you straight to the
  intended page.
  [bug 13503]

* Support for copying or moving the Subversion directory that contains
  the wiki without losing history information has been added.  Note that you
  must move the directory itself, not a parent of it.
  [bug 5912]


0.2.1 (2013-04-05)
------------------

* Fix handling of attachment names that contain spaces.
  [bug 13983]

* Improve performance, especially for pages with a large number of links.
  [bug 14571]

* Fix an issue that could cause "String index out of range: 0 editing a page"
  errors when trying to preview a change to a page.
  [bug 13510]

* Fix an issue that prevented the Attachments page from working if an
  attachment was deleted after a page had been renamed.
  [bug 13574]

* Fix a regression introduced in 0.2.0 that prevented Microsoft Office Open
  XML documents from being uploaded as attachments.
  [bug 13553]


0.2.0 (2012-05-17)
------------------

Migration notes:

Note that changes to the taglib require reviki's entire Tomcat work directory
to be deleted and changes to the CSS require custom per-wiki CSS to be deleted
or updated.

Indexing is now attempted in the background.  If your wiki requires
authenticated read access then username and password properties should be
provided.  For new wikis these should be entered via the ConfigSvnLocation
page, but they can be added for existing wikis by adding them to the file
reviki-data/reviki.properties as shown below for a wiki called "example":

svn-user-example=username
svn-pass-example=password

Enhancements and bug fixes:

* Improvements to as-you-type search results.
  [dbug 6868, 7463]

* Added Diff tab to previews.
  [dbug 5770]

* Added page-scoped attributes that can be defined with a simple key value
  syntax and referenced via a macro and in search queries.
  
* Added the ability to delete attachments.
  [dbug 5814]

* Added support for per-wiki favicons via ConfigIcons/favicon.ico attachment.
  [dbug 5797]

* Support anchors in wiki links such as [[FooBar#Baz]].  Note anchors in pages
  still require HTML.
  [dbug 9684]

* The current page can now be referred to by @_currentPage in search macros.
  [dbug 5785]

* Permit creating a page by uploading an attachment.
  [dbug 7710]

* Allow commit messages for attachments and show their history on the
  attachments page.
  [dbug 8674, 9050]

* Unlock pages when the user navigates away from the edit page without making
  changes.
  [dbug 5823]

* Permit linking to pages with dots in the name.  Previously these were assumed
  to be attachments.  Links now check for pages first, before going on to look
  for attachments.  To unambiguously refer to an attachment use
  "[[attachments/file]]".
  [dbug 5755]

* Fix encoding issues affecting page names containing '+', '?', or Unicode.
  [dbug 5793, 5820]

* Fixed outgoingLinks macro.
  [dbug 9179]

* Fix to respect svn:mime-type of attached files when accessing them.
  [dbug 9367]

* Fix for JSTL EL issue encountered on Tomcat 7.
  [dbug 9863]


0.1.1 (2010-06-24)
------------------

* Fix support for reviki base-url property that was broken in 0.1.0.


0.1.0 (2010-06-11)
------------------

First formal release.  Changes noted are since r1022.

* Now supported on Jetty.

* Cross-wiki search.  Note this requires all wikis to have been indexed, which
  is still done on first access.

* Keyboard shortcuts for edit, save and cancel, with prompt to confirm cancel.

* Fix for incoming/outgoing links calculation for pages with spaces in their
  names [dbug 5821].  To fully benefit from this improvement, search index
  folders should be deleted from the reviki-data directory.

* Fix compare feature to work across page renames [dbug 5813].

* CSS changes to improve table formatting.  Note this requires custom ConfigCss
  pages to be deleted [dbug 5978].

* Fix attachment pages that were showing irrelevant files for commits that
  touched more than one file [dbug 6299].

* Ensure HTTP connections to the SVN server are closed after each request.

* Automatic inter-wiki links for other wikis on the same instance.
